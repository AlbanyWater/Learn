# Pump Stations & Elevated Tanks

The Albany system is primarily gravity-fed from Feura Bush, but three specific zones require boosting.

## System Overview
| Station Name | Service Area | Tank Type | Capacity | Elevation (MSL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upper Service** | Loudonville | Elevated | 150,000 Gal | 472.5' |
| **Pine Bush** | West City / Guilderland | Elevated | 1.0 MG | 470.5' |
| **Colvin Ave** | Harriman Campus | Standpipe | 1.0 MG | 370.0' |

## Pressure Mechanics
* **Gravity Rule:** Every 1 foot of water column creates **0.433 psi** of pressure.
* **Example:** A 100-foot tank creates 43.3 psi at the base ($100 \times 0.433$).

## Maintenance Checks
* **Daily:** Check pump discharge pressures and tank levels via SCADA.
* **Annual:** Inspect internal/external tank conditions (often contracted out).
* **Water Age:** Tanks must be cycled (filled at night, drained during day) to prevent stagnation and loss of chlorine residual.
