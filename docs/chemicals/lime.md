# Hydrated Lime (Ca(OH)₂)

Hydrated Lime is used for pH adjustment and corrosion control. It creates a protective scale on pipes to prevent lead and copper leaching.

## Chemical Properties
* **Form:** White powder (slurry when mixed).
* **pH:** 12.4 (Saturated solution).
* **Solubility:** Poor. Requires constant mixing to prevent settling.

## Handling Procedures
* **Dust Hazard:** Lime dust is a severe respiratory irritant. Always use dust collection systems when loading.
* **Line Clogging:** Lime slurries scale pipes quickly. Lines must be flushed with clear water immediately after use.
