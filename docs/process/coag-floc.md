# Coagulation, Flocculation & Sedimentation

Once raw water enters the plant, the first major treatment phase is **Clarification**. The goal is to remove suspended solids by clumping them together so they settle out.

## 1. Coagulation (The Chemical Mix)
* **What it is:** The addition of a chemical coagulant to neutralize the electrical charge of suspended particles.
* **Chemical Used:** **Polyaluminum Chloride (PAC)** (also known as PCH-180).
* **Process:**
    * Raw water particles are generally negatively charged.
    * PAC (positively charged) is added in the **Rapid Mix** zone.
    * This destabilizes the particles, allowing them to stick together.

## 2. Flocculation (The Slow Mix)
* **Duration:** Approximately **20 minutes**.
* **Process:**
    * Water enters the Mixing Basin.
    * Gentle mixing causes the neutralized particles to collide and clump into larger, heavier masses called **"Floc"**.
    * *Operator Check:* You should be able to visually see floc forming in the basin. If water looks cloudy without distinct clumps, the process may be failing.

## 3. Sedimentation (The Settling)
* **Duration:** Approximately **2 hours**.
* **Capacity:** Each basin holds ~1.5 Million Gallons.
* **Process:**
    * Water flows slowly through the **Settling Basins**.
    * The heavy "Floc" settles to the bottom (forming sludge).
    * The clean, clarified water rises to the top and flows over the weirs into the **Filtration Flume**.
    * *Maintenance:* Sludge must be periodically flushed to the Waste Lagoons to prevent it from becoming septic or carrying over into the filters.
