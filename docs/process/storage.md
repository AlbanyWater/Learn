# Storage & Distribution

The distribution system consists of all pipes, valves, pumping stations, and storage facilities that convey water to the customer.

## Water Storage Tanks
Storage tanks serve three critical functions:
1.  **Equalization:** Allows the plant to run at a steady flow rate while demand fluctuates.
2.  **Emergency Supply:** Provides reserve water for firefighting or power outages.
3.  **Pressure:** Elevated tanks create pressure via gravity.

### Managing "Water Age"
Operators must cycle tanks (fill them up and drain them down) to keep water fresh.
* **Stagnation Risk:** If water sits too long, chlorine residual drops, leading to potential biofilm growth or nitrification.
* **Routine:** Typically, tanks are filled at night (low demand) and drained during the day (high demand).

## Pumping Stations
The system is primarily gravity-fed from Feura Bush, but three specific zones require boosting:

| Station Name | Service Area | Tank Capacity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upper Service** | Loudonville Area | 150,000 Gallons |
| **Pine Bush** | Washington Ave ext. / Guilderland | 1,000,000 Gallons |
| **Colvin Ave** | Harriman Campus Area | 1,000,000 Gallons |

## System Maintenance
* **Corrosion Control:** We maintain a slight scale-forming water chemistry to coat pipes and prevent rust.
* **Boil Water Notices:** Issued if pressure drops below **20 psi** or if a positive *E. coli* sample is confirmed.
