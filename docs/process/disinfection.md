# Disinfection

Disinfection is the process used to inactivate (destroy) harmful microorganisms. While filtration removes particles, disinfection targets bacteria and viruses.

## Disinfection Strategy
We use a multi-barrier approach involving different chemicals at different stages.

| Chemical | Formula | Usage Stage | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sodium Permanganate** | NaMnO4 | Raw Water Intake | Taste/Odor control & Pre-oxidation |
| **Sodium Hypochlorite** | NaClO | Pre-Filtration | Aids filtration & reduces algae growth in basins |
| **Sodium Hypochlorite** | NaClO | Post-Filtration | Primary disinfection to kill bacteria (E. coli) |

## Key Concepts
* **Primary Disinfection:** Occurs in the **Clearwell** (Pure Well). The water must be held here long enough (Contact Time) for the chlorine to effectively kill pathogens before leaving the plant.
* **Residual:** We must maintain a chlorine residual throughout the distribution system to prevent bacterial regrowth in the pipes.

### pH Adjustment
Immediately after disinfection, **Hydrated Lime** ($Ca(OH)_2$) is added.
* **Goal:** To raise the pH and alkalinity.
* **Reason:** To make the water non-corrosive so it does not damage distribution pipes or leach lead from household plumbing.
