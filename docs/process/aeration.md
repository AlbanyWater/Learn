# Aeration Process

Aeration is often the first major process at the treatment plant. It brings water and air into close contact to remove dissolved gases and oxidize dissolved metals.

## How It Works
Aeration works by exposing drops or thin sheets of water to the air, or by introducing small air bubbles.

* **Scrubbing:** Turbulence physically removes dissolved gases from the solution, allowing them to escape into the air.
* **Oxidation:** Oxygen combines with undesirable metals. Once oxidized, these chemicals fall out of solution and become particles that can be removed by filtration.

!!! tip "Efficiency Factors"
    The efficiency of aeration depends on the amount of surface contact between air and water. This is controlled primarily by the size of the water drop or air bubble.

## Impact on Water Quality
* **Taste:** Increases palpability by removing the "flat" taste.
* **Temperature:** Cold water can hold more oxygen than warm water.
* **Corrosion Warning:** Excessive oxygen can make water corrosive or cause "air binding" in filters.

## Chemicals Removed or Oxidized
Aeration effectively targets the following constituents:

* **Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOCs):** Including benzene, trichloroethylene, and others found in industrial processes.
* **Dissolved Gases:** Carbon dioxide, Hydrogen sulfide (Rotten egg odor), Methane.
* **Metals:** Iron and Manganese.
* **Other:** Ammonia and Chlorine.
