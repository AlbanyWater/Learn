# Filtration Process

Following clarification, the water enters the **Filtration** stage. This marks the shift from chemical treatment to physical removal of particles.

## Filter Design
The plant utilizes **Rapid Sand Filters** constructed of reinforced concrete (approx. 34' x 50'). Each filter acts as a physical barrier to remove remaining suspended solids and pathogens (like *Giardia* and *Cryptosporidium*).

| Layer | Material | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top Layer** | Anthracite Coal | Traps larger floc particles |
| **Bottom Layer** | Sand | Polishes water by trapping fine particles |
| **Support** | Gravel | Supports media and distributes backwash water |

## Operational Standards
* **Capacity:** Each filter can process up to **4 Million Gallons Per Day (MGD)**.
* **Turbidity Goal:** Must be $\le 0.3$ NTU in 95% of samples.
* **Absolute Limit:** Turbidity must never exceed 1 NTU.

## The Backwash Cycle
When filter media becomes clogged with trapped solids, efficiency drops and the filter must be cleaned.

1.  **Backwash:** Clean water and air (scour) are forced backward through the filter to lift the bed and scrub the media.
2.  **Filter-to-Waste:** Before returning to service, the filter runs to waste for a short period. This allows the media to settle and ensures no loose particles pass into the clearwell.

!!! warning "Turbidity Spike"
    Rules allow for a temporary increase in turbidity for 4 hours immediately following a backwash, as the filter "seasons" itself.
