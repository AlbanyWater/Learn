# Water Quality Analysis (Daily)

Daily lab analysis is the primary method for validating plant performance and regulatory compliance.

## Routine Bench Tests
Operators must perform the following bench tests every 4 hours.

| Parameter | Target Range | Critical Limit | Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **pH (Raw)** | 6.8 - 7.2 | N/A | Electrometric |
| **pH (Finished)** | 8.0 - 8.5 | < 7.5 | Electrometric |
| **Chlorine (Free)** | 1.8 - 2.2 mg/L | < 1.5 mg/L | DPD Colorimetric |
| **Turbidity (Clearwell)** | < 0.10 NTU | > 0.30 NTU | Nephelometric |
| **Fluoride** | 0.6 - 0.8 mg/L | > 2.0 mg/L | SPADNS |

## Sampling Locations
1.  **Raw Water:** Sample tap located on the incoming 48" line (Pre-Aeration).
2.  **Settled Water:** Sample from the flume exiting the sedimentation basins.
3.  **Entry Point (EP):** Finished water tap in the lab (Representing water entering distribution).

!!! danger "Critical Violation"
    If **Entry Point Free Chlorine** drops below **0.2 mg/L**, you must immediately notify the Chief Operator and start the *Low Chlorine Emergency Protocol*.
