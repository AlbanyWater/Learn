Procedures for flushing sedimentation basins and cleaning chemical lines.

## Sedimentation Basin Flush
**Frequency:** As needed (typically seasonal) or when sludge blanket rises.

    * Isolate Basin Effluent valves.
    * Raise plant elevation to ~21 inches.
    * Open influent for the target **Waste Lagoon**.
2. **Flush:**
    * Crack the Drain valve (15-20 turns) to charge the line.
    * Slowly open fully (15-20 turns every 10 mins).
3. **Wash Down:**

    * Use hose streams to clean corners and drain openings.
4. **Restore:**
    * Close drain and slowly refill over **48 hours**.
    * **Note:** Refill rate should be ~1 MGD > Outflow.
